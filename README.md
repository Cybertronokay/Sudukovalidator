# ðŸ§© Sudoku Validator â€“ Software Engineering Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

**Sudoku Validator** is a full-stack Software Engineering mini project that validates a 9x9 Sudoku grid submitted by a user through a web interface. The grid is passed to a Python Flask API, which writes the input to a file and delegates the actual validation logic to a C++ program.

This project follows **modular design**, uses **file-based inter-process communication**, and integrates a **multithreaded backend** to enhance performance and efficiency.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Multithreading?

To improve the efficiency of validation, the C++ backend uses **multithreading** to **parallelize** the following tasks:

- âœ… Row validation
- âœ… Column validation
- âœ… 3Ã—3 subgrid validation

Each of these is handled in a separate thread using C++'s `<thread>` library. This approach reduces execution time and demonstrates how concurrency improves system performance in real-world software.
